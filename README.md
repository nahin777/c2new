Step 1 Slice the veggies

To prepare this yummy sandwich, peel and slice the onion and cucumber in the round shape. Wash the tomatoes and cut round slices of it as well.
Step 2 Make green chutney

Next, wash and chop the coriander and mint leaves to prepare the green chutney for sandwich. Add them along with green chillies and salt in a mixer jar and blend to a smooth paste, and try not to add too much water.
Step 3 Assemble the sandwich

Trim the bread from all sides and apply butter on one bread, then apply the green chutney all over. Next, place the cucumber, tomato, onion slices over the bread slice along with potato slice. Now, sprinkle salt over the veggies along with chaat masala. Cover this slice with the other one and cut into bite-size pieces.
Step 4 Grill the sandwich and serve hot

Once you are done with placing the sandwich, spread the grated cheese over it. Grill the sandwich for around 2-3 minutes and once done, serve hot.
